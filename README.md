# Elliptic Curve Cryptography - ElGamal Public Key Encryption Chat Service

## Project Description

This secure chat application utilizes Elliptic Curve Cryptography for key generation and the ElGamal public key encryption method for message encryption and decryption. Integrating socket programming with advanced cryptographic techniques, it ensures secure and private client-server communication, protecting messages from unauthorized access.

## Technologies and Concepts
 
- Java
- Main Frame
- Socket Programming
- Multi-Threading

## Getting Started 

## Open Terminal or Command Prompt

### Initial Setup

Navigate to the project directory:

    cd ECC-ElGamal-Chat-Service

### Compilation

1.  **Clean the Project:**
    Remove the `bin` directory and its contents (`.class` files):

        rm -rf bin

2.  **Compile the Source Files:**
    Compile `.java` files and place `.class` files in the `bin` directory:

        mkdir -p bin
        javac -d bin/ src/csc8370/*
        javac -d bin/ -classpath bin/ src/csc8370Main.java

# clean: (To remove the directory 'bin' and all of its contents (.class files))

    rm -rf bin

# compile: (To compile .class files and place them in bin directory)

    mkdir -p bin
    javac -d bin/ src/csc8370/*
    javac -d bin/ -classpath bin/ src/csc8370Main.java

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Server:**
    In the command line, run:

        java -classpath bin/ csc8370Main server

Choose 'server' when prompted to establish the server side.

2.  **Start the Client:**
    Open a new terminal and run:

        java -classpath bin/ csc8370Main client

Choose 'client' when prompted and enter the server's IP address to establish a connection.
